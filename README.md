## 🚀 Before You Start (Mandatory Step!)

Before diving into the exercises and code, it is crucial to have a strong theoretical foundation, especially if you come from a C/C++ background.

🔴 **Please visit the Notes & Preparation repository first:**
### 👉 [Python-Seeds-Notes](https://github.com/hayrix/python-seeds-notes)

In the **Python-Seeds-Notes** repository, you will find detailed explanations of:
* **Philosophy & Basics:** The core differences between Python and C (Interpreted vs. Compiled, Memory Management).
* **Under the Hood:** How the PVM (Python Virtual Machine) and Bytecode work.
* **Style Rules:** A comprehensive guide to using `flake8` and PEP 8 standards for writing clean, professional code.

Reading those notes will save you hours of debugging later!

## 💡 How to Use This Repository?

1.  **Do not copy solutions directly:** Try to solve the exercise yourself first.
2.  **Read the Sub-READMEs:** Inside each folder (e.g., `d00/D00_README.md`), you will find a summary of what you should learn on that day.
3.  **Compare Solutions:** Use the code here to compare with your solution and improve your coding style (Refactoring).
